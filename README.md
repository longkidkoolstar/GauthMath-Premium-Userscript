## Installation

1. **Install a Userscript Manager:** You'll need a browser extension like Tampermonkey (recommended) or Greasemonkey to manage and run userscripts. These extensions are available for most popular browsers.
2. **Install the Userscript:** Copy the entire code from the `GauthMath-Premium-Userscript.user.js` file. Create a new userscript in your userscript manager and paste the code there. Save the script.

## How it Works
